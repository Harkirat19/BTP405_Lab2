Approach 1:
In this way, we make a list of numbers where each number is double the counting number up to a certain limit (in this case, 5). The for loop then goes through this list and prints each number followed by a colon.

Approach 2:
This time, instead of using a separate function, we directly create a list with the same idea: each number is double the counting number from 0 to 4. The for loop then prints each number followed by a colon.

Approach 3:

In this approach, we use a special kind of function called a generator. It produces one number at a time using 'yield', and the for loop then iterates through the values generated by doubleG(5) and prints each element followed by a colon.

The "doubleG(n)" is a generator function. It uses the yield statement to produce a sequence of values, one at a time when iterated.
This is good when dealing with lots of numbers because it does not use up too much memory all at once, making things work faster and more smoothly. So, it's like a smart way of handling numbers without using too much space or time.
