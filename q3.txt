Hey there, I'm a Software Development student who has a moderate knowledge of programming languages like C, C++, Python, JavaScript & HTML/CSS and some basic knowledge about virtual machines, and operating systems like Linux,Windows. I like to write my codes using VS Code Editor.

I try to be Positive 99% of the time and always keep the "Can Do It Attitude" in mind.
I also love to Workout, listen Music, and play Chess.
